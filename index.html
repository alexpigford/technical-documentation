        <article>
          <p>
            The hunters are a group of warriors who are dedicated to keeping
            their regions safe by hunting down beasts - or anything other than
            beasts if need be - that pose a threat. Hunters are agile fighters
            armed with a trick weapon, a transforming melee weapon in the right
            hand, and a firearm in the left. They do not employ shields, but
            rather take advantage of their mobility in order to avoid attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hunters exist throughout the world and are not exclusive to Yharnam,
            since a number of characters such as the protagonist and Eileen come
            from the outside world and are yet still recognized as hunters.
            However, it is believed that the Hunters started out as a branch of
            the Healing Church very much like The Choir. This would mean that,
            at least in Yharnam, Hunters were recruited by either Gehrman or the
            Church itself.

        <article>
          <p>
            Yharnam is a towering, labyrinthine gothic city, home to both the
            Healing Church and the Blood Ministrations. As no evidence of the
            existence of a ruling body is provided in the game, one may presume
            that the Healing Church controls the city (at least indirectly). The
            Church focuses around healing by infusions of blood. Miraculously,
            blood healing can repair wounds and cure or hinder diseases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yharnam's whole culture became focused on blood, even to the point
            of blood-based drinks surpassing alcoholic beverages as the most
            commonly consumed. Yharnam's populace is apparently viewed as insane
            or degenerate by the wider world, and the citizens have become
            extremely distrustful of non-natives as a result.

          <p>
            The Red Moon is a nightmare revealed after slaying Rom, the Vacuous
            Spider who had placed a veil over the world to keep the secret of
            the true nature of the world from its residents. The servants of
            Amygdala become fully powered, the beasts become more ravenous, and
            the children of Amygdala are visible at last. In this nightmare, the
            world reveals the Eldritch abominations it has been truly hiding.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, everything gets worse, and the character sees the world
            as they would if they had amassed 40 insight. Unfortunately, by
            killing Rom, you usher in the Red Moon, which is believed by some to
            be the coming of Oedon. It is not clear that Oedon is the Moon
            Presence, but he very well could be.

          <p>
            While this presents a weird part of the story, it is a known fact
            that 75% of the game's umbilical cords can be found on women or
            children. During the Red Moon, Iosefka's dialogue suggests that she
            has become pregnant, and Arianna gets pregnant as well. You also
            find a cord from defeating Mergo's Wet Nurse. This suggests that
            Oedon impregnates women on the Red Moon. The criteria of these women
            who are impregnated has not been determined. It also seems to be
            that the Great Ones impregnate women to have surrogate children. It
            is worth noting that one of the four umbilical cords is in the
            abandoned Workshop, very near the doll.

            The most common form of the blood sickness appears to be
            lycanthropy: Humans slowly turning into wolves. Those in the early
            stages of the sickness have lengthened canine teeth and grow more
            hair. As they progress, their arms and legs lengthen and the spine
            hunches over and the face begins to elongate. Eventually, they grow
            fur and their body finishes the change into a

            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with the physical transformation comes a mental degradation:
            At first the victim assumes all people they don't know are hostile
            and they'll attack on sight. As the alterations progress, the victim
            becomes more and more savage and hostile, until it can only stand to
            be around others exactly like it as "regular" humans appear to be
            beasts through their own blood-addled eyes. Sometimes individuals
            react strangely to the blood; some become unique beasts, and it's
            rumored that infected Clerics of the Healing Church become the
            largest of the monsters when they succumbed to the madness.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood sickness seems to be endemic to Yharnam, requiring
            periodic hunts for those very far gone. The hunters are both
            respected and feared: They bring down the worst of the beasts, but
            are at risk of contamination themselves.

          <p>
            Eventually, Old Yharnam was founded (obviously just “Yharnam” at the
            time), but it was brought low by a strange (the text says
            “baffling”) illness known as Ashen Blood, which was a worse form of
            slow/fast poison. The antidote description cites it as being a more
            severe case, and in the case of Ashen Blood, the antidotes only
            provided temporary relief. Eventually, the disease (likely spread
            due to blood ministrations) took over, and those infected turned
            into beasts. This is why the beasts in Old Yharnam are poisonous,
            particularly the red-eyed werewolf near the boss, and why the
            Blood-Starved Beast is coated with poison.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the fall of Old Yharnam, it was closed up, and Central Yharnam
            was built, along with the Grand Cathedral. This is perhaps the first
            instance of “hunters” as we know them now being formed. The Powder
            Kegs were a group of hunters that tried to make explosive weapons,
            to varying degrees of success. A few prided creations of the
            Powdered Kegs are the Stake Driver, the Rifle Spear, and the Cannon.
            However, due to differences in designs, they were banned from the
            Workshop, becoming known as Workshop Heretics.

            Perhaps the most influential of the organizations, the Healing
            Church was founded in the wake of the Choir. There were three
            echelons to the church: black-garbed hunters, white-garbed
            “doctors,” and the Choir. Though they did not spring from
            Byrgenwerth directly, they were explorers who found the labyrinth in
            the wake of that place and discovered the same remnants of the
            Truth, and used the research done there already to kick off their
            own research. However, their form of metamorphosis began with Blood
            Ministrations and their research/experiments with the blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Master Laurence, the founder of the Healing Church, and one of
            Master Willem's apprentices believed that in order to transcend
            humanity they had to research blood healing using Old Blood. During
            the times of Byrgenwerth, Master Willem taught all of his student to
            blindfold themselves so that they can "look into oneself" and that
            they needed to "line their brain with eyes" in order to see what the
            Great Ones see and acquire more eldritch knowledge, also known as
            insight, to further evolve into greater beings. With insight, they
            were able to see the world for what it is, beyond human
            comprehension. One of the most important of Willem's teachings is
            the Byrgenwerth adage "Fear the Old Blood". For only Willem respects
            and fears the true nature of the Old Blood in the beginning.

            The leaders of the healing church, the Choir differentiate
            themselves from the rest of the members of the church as they
            received teachings directly from Ebrietas. Ebrietas, daughter of the
            cosmos is a celestial being who emerged from the depth of the Old
            Labyrinth and acted as a source of knowledge to the healing church
            with seemingly no ill-will thus furthering the notion that the Great
            Ones are sympathetic to humans. Not only did Ebrietas grant members
            of the Choir profound knowledge, but she also further convinced them
            that they could commune with the Great Ones and learn the Eldritch
            Truth. They believed they could ascend to the Cosmos (or at least
            make contact with it), and it came in a sudden and unexpected
            realization that perhaps while their feet were rooted to the ground,
            the cosmos was not immeasurably far away, but right above their
            heads. Together with Ebrietas, the Choir worked tirelessly to
            understand the Great One's Truth.

            Members of the School of Mensis desperately seek communion with the

            dandies, the first Vileblood that partook in corrupted blood from
            Byrgenwerth. Having the ability to extract the essence of hunters'
            blood, Queen Annalise ordered her followers to hunt down hunters
            without scruple, and gained notoriety for her insatiable hunger for
            blood.

            The Healing Church has pursued a strange goal for a long, long time;
            a goal that has been hidden from all but the highest of rank among
            them: to summon or harness the power of the Great Ones, beings not
            of this world, powerful enough to be seen as gods. They were here,
            in the labyrinth, long ago. They appear to be much closer than you'd
            think at Byrgenwerth, men were sent into the labyrinth, and an
            academy was built to understand the strange discoveries inside,
            generally called the Truth. It seems the Truth is a terrible thing,
            slowly breaking the mind of anyone who delves too deeply. Awful
            things happened at Bygenwerth, and as a result, the church closed
            off not only the academy, but the entire forest, calling it
            "forbidden".

            Pthumeria was an ancient civilization ruled by Queen Yharnam. It was
            populated by Pthumerians, an ancient race of people who truly
            understood the Truth of the Great Ones and gained supernatural
            powers as a result. Queen Yharnam was a medium for the Great Ones,
            as cited by an item (saying the Choir discovered a medium, though
            she's the only likely candidate). Eventually the Pthumerians
            retreated into a deep labyrinth, with their holy chalices being the
            only remnants of their ancient rituals to break the seals. Some
            chalices (such as the ailing Loran chalice) led to other lands, and
            the Isz Chalice was in particular used in holy communion with the
            Great Ones.

            In time, a man named Gehrman would rise to the task of the Beast

            defense against the beasts' claws, and also created the Burial

            cater to Gehrman's need for a short or long weapon. Gehrman's work
            was so admired as well as effective that his Burial Blade would
            become the basis for all hunter armament technology, later known as
            trick weapons. Gehrman was also a formidable fighter whose school of
            thought would become mandatory in any hunter's fighting style when
            facing the horrors of the hunt.

            In time, hunters needed to receive blood ministrations in order to
            compete with the beasts they hunted, as a kind of all-or-nothing
            gamble. However, many hunters would fail, and become obsessed with,
            infected by, and eventually overcome by the blood, becoming beasts
            themselves. For this, the Hunter of Hunters did their duty, ending
            the lives of these madmen with grace and dignity.

            Alfred is a hunter as well as an executioner, he has sworn to slay
            beasts as well as the Vilebloods of Cainhurst Castle sworn to Queen
            Annalise. Although the executioners are better known for their
            resolution, their ferocious penchant for killing, and their
            "merciless" nature, Alfred is surprisingly jolly and asks to
            befriend the player and to be comrades in arms against the scourge
            of the Vilebloods and the beasts alike.

            A member of the Powdered Kegs, Djura renounced his title of hunter
            when he failed to protect Old Yharnam. Stubborn as always, Djura
            remained in Old Yharnam as he watched the inhabitants of his town
            slowly decayed into beasts, but insists on protecting them
            nonetheless.
